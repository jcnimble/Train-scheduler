# Train-scheduler
Another successful assignment very tied to what we learned in class -- this is the ideal learning experience for me.  

I started with recreating the layout.  I did this from scratch using BootStrap which was pretty easy to recreate.

I also set up my firebase database with no issue.

I started with the Employee Time Sheet that we did as a group as a guide for my javascript, but some of my group members are more experienced and used some short-cuts that I found difficult to follow. I went to the solution file and followed along there.  It may be a bit plodding and have extra code, but for a newbie it was ideal. I particularly like how the row add was executed. I really had difficulty following my groups initial menthod on this.  I liked how it cleared the form after submission and how it had an alert that let you know it was submitted -- another good additions.

I then went on to the time calculations.  Once again, I used the class activity as a guide which was successful. Using what I learned I was able to reformat the end time to match the homework image. So, another win.

I could spend hours messing around with CSS.  I do like adding images to the jumbotron.  I was trying to add a background image and make it opaqe to increase readability. But, when I adjust the opacity it affects the type. I messed around with it for a while and couldn't get it exactly where I wanted it.  Needed to move on.  I played with color palletes on this.

Finally, I had an issue with the train info being submitted on an enter after a form panel was completed. I was able to find that fix on line -- another win!! I went in and deleted data in the firebase database to clean up the output and the results of the "enter bug". Ad re-entered data similar to the home work image.
